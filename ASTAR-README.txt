# Graph.ts
Our implementation only has the file 'Graph.ts'. The function aStarSearch contains three helperfunctions called 'getNeighbours', 'distance' and 'constuctPath'. The purpose of these functions should be pretty self explanatory.
One thing worth noting is the that the fScore is set twice if the condition on line 93 is fulfilled. There is ways around this but we deemed further improvement unnecessary.
